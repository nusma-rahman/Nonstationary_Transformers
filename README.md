# Non-stationary Transformers

This repository contains the regenerated code base for the paper titled:
[Non-stationary Transformers: Exploring the Stationarity in Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14415), NeurIPS 2022. [[Slides]](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/8d6ce7b18d3c468190e7/), [[Poster]](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/6eea66909aa7465ca9a4/).

## Preparation

1. This repository contains two scripts: one for the traffic dataset and another for the weather dataset. Change the root path and data path accordingly in the Bash script.

2.  To run the Bash script on a MacBook using VSCode, you can use the following command:

```
chmod +x ns_trans_traffic.sh
./ns_trans_traffic.sh

```

```
chmod +x ns_trans_weather.sh
./ns_trans_weather.sh

```
2. All the datasets can be obtained from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CC4ZrUD4EKncndzgy5PSTzOPSqcuyqqj/view?usp=sharing) or [Tsinghua Cloud](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/b8f4a78a39874ac9893e/?dl=1).
